# Bill Splitter App

Hey folks! 

I'm trying to practice what I've learned. Again a simple application. When it's complicated, I can't get out of it. Anyway... 
The application has a simple working logic. Together with the tip, we calculate the amount to be paid per person.

## What did I do?
- There are no alerts in the original version of the app. No warning is shown to the user.I show a warning to the user when the number of people is 12.
- Switching between pages was used with the present modally method. I embedded navigation controller in the app instead.
- I transferred data between controllers. (I'm still in the process of learning this.)
- I used stepper in the application. This is something new for me.
